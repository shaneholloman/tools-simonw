This page provides an interactive REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) interface for communicating with a microcontroller badge via Web Serial API, enabling users to execute Python commands and view real-time responses in a terminal emulator. The interface includes connection management, command input with quick-access buttons for common operations, and automatic error filtering during the connection phase and import statements. The application handles serial communication with proper stream management and includes safeguards to interrupt any running programs upon connection.
